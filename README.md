# Kick-Drum-Corpus
Here is a dataset of kick drum with genre label.

## Corpus Details
The four most common styles were chosen and then the kicks were classified into five categories: pop kick, punchy kick, stomp kick, top kick and others. In this kick corpus, there are 100 kick files for each category. All the kick samples were collected or created manually. The corresponding mixed song tracks with kicks are generated from kick samples and licensed music stems, which are used in our training and testing process.
